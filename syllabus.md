## VIII. Computer Accounts
You don't need an account to login in to the classroom Macs.

All of these Macs are on "deep freeze" which means when you restart the machine every change you made or file you saved is wiped out. Always restart the machine (rather than logout) when you are done for the day. So bring a USB drive to class, or save your files to the cloud before you leave.

If you have a problem using any of the Macs, please bring it to my attention.

## IX. iOS Hardware
Many of you already have access to an iOS device. For the others we have a selection of iOS devices (iPad Airs and Apple Watches) to loan out.

1. **Important - bring your iOS device and cable to class every day**
2. Bring headphones to listen to tutorial videos or tune out distractions 

## X. Mac Hardware

- 10 IST Macs are available in the IST Open Lab GOL-2670 - they are currently running Xcode 10.1
- Wallace Library has iMacs for use, and Mac laptops to sign out - they are currently running Xcode ??
- You may wish to install Xcode on your own Apple computer. A newer Mac is required to run Xcode 10.1.

## XI. Attendance

Attendance is mandatory and you are expected to be on time. Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and will be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early).

### Classroom Behavior

**You should not be talking to another student while the instructor is speaking. Doing so means that:**

* you cannot hear what the instructor is saying ...
* neither can the person you are speaking to ...
* nor can nearby students.

These are all bad things - so please respect this rule, and raise your hand if you have a question.

**Keep your voice at a reasonable level:**

Typically after the lecture you will be given time to work on an assignment. Quiet discussion and conversation is allowed and the volume needs to be kept at a low level so as to not disturb your classmates. 

If you are easily distracted by background noise, you may wish to bring headphones to class and wear them while working on assignments.

**Excessively checking your email, playing games, surfing the web, or working on assignments during lectures can have negative impacts:**

* Performing more than one task at the same time is difficult. While you are paying attention to the computer, you are likely missing out on the content of the lecture.
* You are also distracting neighboring students.
* If your computer screen is visible to the hallway, your behavior is broadcast to a broader audience (students, faculty, administrators, visiting parents, ...) and reflects poorly, especially on you.
* Violations of these classroom behavior policies will be dealt with through deductions in your attendance grade.

## XII. How to succeed in this class

iOS programming can be difficult for newcomers - the new Swift language is an improvement over Objective-C but it's only 2-1/2 years old and has gone though several versions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 4.0), so it still has its quirks. You may have to work harder than you are used to, especially at the beginning.

* Get to class everyday, on time, and be ready to work. Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class.
* Do the assignments and complete the Study Guides. Be sure to save your Study Guides - future test questions will be pulled from them and the in-class assignments.
* Take notes - either handwritten or electronically (Markdown, Word Doc, or Google Doc). It will help you to pay attention and remember the material.
* Start assignments early! Don't wait until the night before.
* On the projects, do portfolio quality work that you would be willing to show a potential employer.
* Ask questions in class for clarification
* See me outside of class if you are having trouble.
* **Install apps on your iOS hardware** you'll lose points otherwise! Don't just run everything in the iOS simulator. Why?
Your app is "cooler" when it's on your phone, even if it's just a lame demo.
Usability issues are often immediately apparent, especially when you let someone else try the app.
Apps install faster and run faster on your device than they do on the iOS simulator.



## XIII. Grading

- Projects: 50%
- Exams: 30%
- HW: 15%
- Attendance: 5%

Final course grades are determined using the following scale: 

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+%	| A |
| 80+%	| B |
| 70+%	| C |
| 65+%	| D |
| <65%	| F |


Note: Grade A = superior work, not just satisfactory.

Note: 1 absence 4/5 points, 2 absences 3/5 points, 3 absences 1.5/5 points, 4 absences 0 points. Each additional absence is 5% off of final average. Late is 1/2 absence. Facebooking or similar off-task activity during lectures or demos will count as a absence for the day.

Note: There are no make-ups and no extra credit.

Note: HW and ICE will NOT be accepted late without a valid excuse (procrastination, and missing the dropbox by 1 minute, are not valid excuses). If you feel you have legitimate excuse, please contact the professor outside of class either by email or during office hours. The lowest homework grade will be automatically dropped by mycourses, so you can get a zero on 1 assignment and not be penalized.

Note: Late projects are sometimes accepted.

Note: The MAXIMUM grade awarded on any late project is an 85%

## XIV. Academic Integrity
ANY instance of academic dishonesty (cheating, collusion, or duplicate submission) will result in a failing grade in the course and will be reported to the chair of the student's home department. This policy includes all assignments, including seemingly trivial ones like homework. There will be no second chances given.

## XV. Notices of Accommodation
If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", I should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met.

## XVI. Important RIT Deadlines
- Last day of add/drop is the beginning of week 2.
- Last day to withdraw with a grade of W is the end of week 11.
- You have one semester to challenge your grade. After that, grades cannot be challenged (IGM department policy).
- All of the information on this page is subject to change.
